# OSRS botting scripts for DreamBot client 
##### All scripts were written by me. Mostly for fun and personal use.

#### ‚ùó I'm not maintaining any of these scripts and never will. It's possible that most of them don't even work anymore. This repository was originally private but I decided to make it public so people can use my scripts as a learning source. There is a lot of shitcode in some of them.
